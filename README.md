## "Internet is beautiful" web page
I created this web page for personal purposes only. I got inspired by the subreddit r/InternetIsBeautiful.  
I wanted to have a list of links I was insterested in visiting or I visited often, and a brief description of each one.  

### Technologies and languages I used for this project
- Bootsrap  
  I wanted to create something quickly, so I decided to try a Bootstrap template, and modify only the HTML file. The template I used was [this one](https://startbootstrap.com/template/scrolling-nav).
